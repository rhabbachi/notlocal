## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a Docksal Addon that provides a substitude the system stack that helps run Docksal on a VPS.

This is a global plugin to be installed on the global docksal directory (usually ~/.docksal/).

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
As far as I can tell, right now there is no way to install docksal addons from
repositories other then the default https://github.com/docksal/addons.
To workaround that we just need to clone this repository to the global docksal addon folder.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rhabbachi/notlocal ~/.docksal/addons/notlocal
```
